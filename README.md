📘 Project Overview <br>
**Flight Prices Predictions**<br>
Built a Random Forest model to predict flight ticket prices with feature engineering, data preprocessing, and performance evaluation using metrics like R² and MAPE. Applied hyperparameter tuning (RandomizedSearchCV) to enhance accuracy and model reliability.
